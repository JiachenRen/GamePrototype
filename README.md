# Game Prototype
Game prototype for CS 6457 Video Game Design.

## Controls
Move with `WASD`. Move mouse cursor to change move direction. Hold down `shift` to run. Press `space` to jump. Press `Q` to do a rapid punch + upper cut + dive roll combo.

Use `Environment` to set lighting to `Day`, `Night`, or `Dusk` dynamically.

- Devil (FloatDevil model)
- Medfan_BarrelsAndBoxes

### Shaders & materials

- QUAS-Lite (water shader)
- Skybox Cubemap Extended (skybox material & shader)
